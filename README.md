## How to play
 Initially you must choose how many cards each person will have at the beginning of the game by using the joystick near the screen, once you have set this you can start playing by pushing the button.  
 The Card-Dealer will now make a complete turn on itself to detect how many people there are and where, to do so each person should come near to the dealer with his hand ( distance sensor used has some problems with certain types of tissues ).
